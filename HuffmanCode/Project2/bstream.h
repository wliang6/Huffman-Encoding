 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 * Defines the ibstream and obstream classes which are basically
 * same as the ordinary istream and ostream classes, but add the 
 * functionality to read and write one bit at a time. 
 * 
 * The idea is that you can substitute an ibstream in place of an
 * istream and use the same operations (get, fail, >>, etc.) 
 * along with added member functions of readBit, rewind, and size.
 *
 * Similarly, the obstream can be used in place of ofstream, and has
 * same operations (put, fail, <<, etc.) along with additional
 * member functions writebit and size.
 *
 * There are two subclasses of ibstream: ifbstream and istringbstream,
 * which are similar to the ifstream and istringstream classes.	 The
 * obstream class similarly has ofbstream and ostringbstream as
 * subclasses.
